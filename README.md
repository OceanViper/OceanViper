- 👋 Hi, I’m @OceanViper
- 👀 I’ve addicted to Xlights since 2016. Kudos to Keith Westley, Sean Meighan, and the Xlights community.
- I Sequence all year long every year. 

I beleive change first starts from within yourself. Before you attempt to change the world,
make sure your own life and house are in order. Start by making your bed. Don't try to start a revolution until you can start a lawnmower.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Ardour on Linux.
- 💞️ I am a life long professional muscian, and singer. You will find my album on itunes, amazon, CD baby, and more. Search for Nelson Rogers
- 📫 Also a webmaster since 1995. I own several websites. Reach me ==> nrclaims@yahoo.com
I am busier than a one legged man in a ass kicking contest. But not to busy to follow Jesus...
Thanks for reading and God Bless
